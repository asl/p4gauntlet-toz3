# ToZ3: The P4-to-Z3Py Interpreter
ToZ3 produces intermediate Python code that can be used to generate Z3
expressions from P4 programs. The code does not work without the parent repository
[Gauntlet](https://github.com/p4gauntlet/gauntlet). Please see more details there.

This is a WiP rewrite of the original Python interpreter.
